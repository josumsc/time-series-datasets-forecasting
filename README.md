# Approach to Time Series Forecasting

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the main methods used while dealing with time series data, such as Exponential Smoothing, Naïve methods or more advanced ones such as the infamous Facebook Prophet.

I will be using the time series datasets located at [Kaggle - Time Series Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/shenba/time-series-datasets?select=sales-of-shampoo-over-a-three-ye.csv). These datasets will be also located at the `./data` folder for convenience will examining this repository, although please feel free to download them directly from the website if you wish to do so.

The datasets used in the project are the following:

- **Electric Production**: Monthly data of the industrial production of electric and gas utilities in the United States, from the years 1985–2018.
- **Daily Minimum Temperatures**: Daily data of the minimum temperatures registered in the city of Melbourne from 1981 to 1990.
- **Monthly Beer Production**: Monthly data regarding the production of beer in Austria from 1956 to 1995.
- **Sales of Champoo**: Monthly data regarding the sales of champoo during the years 2001-2003.

In order to facilitate the use of the code located in this repository I've also provided the file `./time-series-forecasting.yaml` which can be installed using the [Conda cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) after installing the [Anaconda navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
